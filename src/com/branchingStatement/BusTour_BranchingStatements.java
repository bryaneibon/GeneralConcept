/**
 * Typical task for a job interview.
 *********************************************************************
 * A bus tour of Europe has been very successful. Due to an increase in the number of people that want to go on a tour,
 * the tour company decided to increase the height of the bus. The new height of the bus is exactly N centimeters.
 *
 * But the tourâ€™s route runs under a lot of bridges,
 * and there is a chance that the bus will crash into one of these bridges.
 * Can you find out if this will happen?
 *
 * The first line of the input contains the height of the bus and number of bridges under which the bus passes.
 * The second line contains heights of these bridges.
 *
 * You should output "Will not crash" if everything will be all right; otherwise,
 * output "Will crash on bridge i" (where i is a number of a bridge) into which the bus will crash.
 * If the height of a bridge equals the height of the bus, the bus will crash.
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 * 234 8
 * 465 453 981 463 1235 871 475 981
 * Sample Output 1:
 * Will not crash
 *
 * Sample Input 2:
 * 211 5
 * 871 205 123 871 1681
 * Sample Output 2:
 * Will crash on bridge 2
